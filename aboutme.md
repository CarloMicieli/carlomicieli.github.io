title: About me
---

My name is Carlo Micieli

- I'm a software engineer with 15+ years of experience. Since my humble beginning when I was writing programs with basic on my commodore 64, the guiding principle during my professional career is to always use the appropriate tool to solve the problem at hand. I can write code with C#, Java and Scala. I had exposure to both relational databases (ORACLE, Sql server) and NoSql databases (MongoDB).

- I have a true passion for the software development process, from specification to testing (or from testing to development, when I'm using TDD). I am passionate about deepening my knowledge of new technologies.

- I'm an internal trainer, teaching sql to non IT colleagues. I love to share my knowledge as much as I love to learn new things.
