As a Principal Engineer and Technical Lead on Klarna’s Payments API, I specialize in designing, developing, and scaling critical backend services that power Klarna’s global purchase flow. I lead cross-functional initiatives that align technical solutions with business goals, focusing on system reliability, scalability, and performance.

With hands-on experience in backend development (Java, Spring Boot), I’ve driven key projects such as market expansions, 3D Secure enhancements, KYC integrations, and Apple Pay enablement—directly impacting customer experience and business growth. I also mentor engineers, foster technical knowledge-sharing, and actively contribute to Klarna’s hiring process.

Passionate about building resilient, high-impact systems, I aim to deliver technical excellence while enabling team success and continuous learning.
