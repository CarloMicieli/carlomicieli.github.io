## Introduction

Welcome to my new blog! This site is built with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) and the **Tabi** theme.

This is a sample post to verify that:
1. Syntax highlighting works.
2. The `post.html` template renders correctly.
3. Typography looks good.

## Code Highlighting

Since we are using Zola, let's look at some **Rust** code:

```rust
fn main() {
    let blog_name = "Carlo's Blog";
    println!("Welcome to {}!", blog_name);
}
```

And here is some **JavaScript** for good measure:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    console.log('The DOM is ready!');
});
```

## Typography Test

Here is a blockquote:

> "Simplicity is the soul of efficiency."
> — Austin Freeman

### Lists

Ordered list:
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

Unordered list:
- Apple
- Banana
- Cherry
